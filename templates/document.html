                            </li>
                            <li>The <code>CustomerID</code> column is removed as it is not used for prediction.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Preprocessing Steps:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>One-Hot Encoding:</strong> Categorical features are encoded to numerical values using one-hot encoding. This transformation is applied to specific columns based on their indices.</li>
                            <li><strong>Standard Scaling:</strong> Numeric features are scaled to standardize their ranges.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li><strong>Customer Retention:</strong> <span class="important">E-commerce Platforms</span>: This model can be used by online retailers to predict which customers are likely to stop using their services. By identifying these customers, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn rates.</li>
                        <li><strong>Marketing Strategies:</strong> <span class="important">Personalized Marketing</span>: Companies can use the predictions to tailor marketing campaigns. For instance, special offers or incentives can be given to customers predicted to churn in an effort to retain them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> <span class="important">Customer Support</span>: Resources can be allocated more effectively by focusing on high-risk customers who are predicted to churn. This helps in prioritizing support and intervention efforts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> <span class="important">Business Strategy</span>: Insights from the model can inform strategic decisions regarding customer service improvements, product offerings, and overall business strategy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Subscription Services:</strong> <span class="important">Media and Entertainment</span>: Streaming services or subscription-based platforms can use this model to forecast which subscribers may cancel their subscriptions, allowing them to proactively address potential issues and improve customer satisfaction.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>By leveraging this model, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling them to take proactive measures to enhance customer retention and drive long-term growth.</p>
